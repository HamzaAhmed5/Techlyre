People in Lebanon are angry at the government over the explosion because it has admitted that the chemicals, in the warehouse that exploded, weren't being stored safely.

Lots of people have taken to the streets to protest against the government.

The chemicals could be used for things like farming fertilisers but there are normally strict rules around how to store it to stop anything like this from happening.

But authorities in the country say the rules weren't being followed and they're looking into how and why the explosion - and the fire before it - started. Some people who worked there aren't allowed to leave their homes now until these investigations get under way.

Lebanon used to belong to France and the French President, Emmanuel Macron, visited the city on Thursday and promised help. He also said Lebanon needed to see "profound change" from authorities.

He called for an international investigation into the disaster too.

Lebanon is also going through a [tough time at the moment with money worries](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/50155766) as well as dealing with the coronavirus pandemic like most countries around the world.
